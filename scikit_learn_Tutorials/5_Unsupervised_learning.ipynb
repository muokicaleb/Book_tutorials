    "A Hierarchical clustering method is a type of cluster analysis that aims to build a hierarchy of clusters. In general, the various approaches of this technique are either:\n",
    "   * Agglomerative - bottom-up approaches: each observation starts in its own cluster, and clusters are iteratively merged in such a way to minimize a linkage criterion. This approach is particularly interesting when the clusters of interest are made of only a few observations. When the number of clusters is large, it is much more computationally efficient than k-means.\n",
    "   * Divisive - top-down approaches: all observations start in one cluster, which is iteratively split as one moves down the hierarchy. For estimating large numbers of clusters, this approach is both slow (due to all observations starting as one cluster, which it splits recursively) and statistically ill-posed\n",
